reactjs best practices:
-----------------------


1) state - avoid state

    <container>
        data
            <some act comp>
                always take data from container
            </some act comp>
    </container>

    Flux pattern for handling state in react apps.

2) Prop types - define it
              - this help track all props in app


3) render -
    + app logic inside render method
    + avoid logic in component lifecycle method
    + less state and less props , cleaner will be the code
    + calculate state / props inside the render method.


4) Composition -
    one component one functionality

5) HOC - High Order Components

    deprecated -- mixins for handling reusable components
