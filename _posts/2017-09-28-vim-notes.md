VIM
---
For git only:

    Set core.editor in your Git config: git config --global core.editor "vim" 
            (or)
"   Set the GIT_EDITOR environment variable: export GIT_EDITOR=vim
For all pgms:
    export VISUAL=vim 
    export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

Sublime text as editor for git:
-------------------------------
[core] editor = 'subl' --wait 
    (It allows to type text in sublime and will wait for save / close event. )
		
		
yy (shortcut of y_) = y_
yw = yank word
yW = yank FULL word ( with dots)
ma => mark a
`a => move to mark a
y'a => yank till a (book)mark
d'a => delete
p
:.,$j => Join lines
3,12 s/\<the\>/THEXXX/g => replace only "the" to THEXXX, 
						   DON'T replace "then".
```

##od -x to view in hexdecimal format
```vi
# vim only
:%!xxd and :%!xxd -r
```

## copy shell command output to vi directly

```vi
:r!ls -l
copies the directory listing  to vi editor

on windows
:r!dir
```


## vi string replace

```sh
replace All to ALL in line 1 and 2 only .
and also ask for confirmation

:1,2 s/All/ALL/gc

c=> confirmation

--------------

:g/^All/d
delete all lines starting with All

:v/^All/d
delete except all lines starting with All

```sh

## vim

```sh
vim line statistics
g ctrl+G => 


ghex2 gnome binary editor


cycling between tabs in vim

gt
[n]gt
gt => forward order
gT => reverse order


vim -p ./*

--------

double space lines
:g/^/put_

-----------

print lines

:g/fdfd/#

without # will print lines witout line number ( if the file currently viewed 
without line no)

useful before doing any opearation on the range of lines for example

if we want to delete lines matching with space ( start of search ) , put (end of search)
do 
:g/space/,/put/#
and view the lines and delete using
:g/space/,/put/d

```

## no. of matches
```vi
no. of matches of "AND" on the line#
:139s/AND//gn

no. of matches of "AND" on the entire file
:%s/AND//gn
```

case insensitive search in vim using * ? how ?

undo = u
redo = ?

gf => open file in a new window.

:nmap <c-s> :w<CR>
    for ctrl + s => save shortcut
    how to unmap it ?

repeated set of chars
      (<char>)\1{<no.of.times-1>}

/\(.\)\1\{4\}
\(.\)\1\{4\}
\(.\)\1\{3\}
\([a-z]\)\1\{3\}
\([a-z]\)\1\{1\}
\([a-z][a-z]\)\1\{1\}
[0-9]


-----------

5 letter palindrome

/\([a-z]\)\([a-z]\)[a-z]\2\1
    1st   2nd     mid   \2nd \1st letters
    match match letter
