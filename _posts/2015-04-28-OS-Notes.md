## aix, oracle
```sh

debugger
gdb /bin/ls

aix dbx

oracle dead lock 

to avoid "order" should be same for all process.
if ORACLE find deadlock it steps in and throws ORA-00060 error.
but no commit or rollback occurs.
so both session still in the wait mode.
only thing there is a notification to show there was a deadlock scenario.
```

## how host entry affects the browser
```sh
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

to forget about the browser client saved passwords  use the ip entry in "hosts" file
and give alias, use the alias to refer and now the old saved information nolonger 
populated automatically, since the browser thinks as this is new domain.!!!
```
